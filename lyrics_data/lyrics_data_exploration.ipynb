    "\n",
    "Everyone knows that 90% of the time data scientists want to be building and fine tuning their models, but unfortunately they tend to spend 90% of their time collecting and preparing their datasets for said model instead. In light of this, we figured it would be a good idea to show off our own data cleansing skills and demonstrate the process in action using jupyter notebooks. More specifically, we are going to use this notebook to document the steps taken to prepare the lyrical dataset we will be using for training our generative Steely Dan song writing model.\n",

    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using for this project is a collection of 57,650 from 643 different artists, including 88 Steely Dan songs. This dataset of songs was scraped from the website [lyricsfreak](https://www.lyricsfreak.com/) and is available at the following [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics), compliments of Sergey Kuznetsov who took the liberty of scraping the data and providig it publicly.\n",

    "The dataset is conveniantly stored in a csv file, so the first thing we want to do is load in the file using Pandas and take a look at its structure as well as a couple example records."

As can we see, the lyrics for each are completely different and the two are distinct songs despite having the same name."

For instance, below are two records of the song \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\", one by America and the other by Barbra Streisand.

This library has a useful function called fuzzy match that tells us how similar two strings are.

Additionally, the fuzzywuzzy library has additional functions that preprocess the strings for us to improve the comparison. Below we test several of these functions on the two \"Movin' Out\" songs and the two \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\" songs from earlier.

Though the \"token set ratio\" function returns pretty high values in this case, they are still distinguishably lower than when the songs are similar. As such, I am still leaning towards using this function over the others, possibly with a cutoff value of 90 for matches.\n",

For example, the song \"The Very Thought Of You\" still shows up twice in our dataset with the exact same text for each. Turns out the two records have slightly different titles, with the other being \"Very Thought Of You\", which is why we did not try comparing or removing them. There are numerous examples of this behavior. To try and address it, below we wrote another function that removes any duplicates with the exact same text. Note this takes about 5 minutes to run."

    "The types of patterns we don't want our model to learn are abnormalities and formatting shorthands that are present in a lot of the song text. For example, comments on the artist, song version, etc. at the start of the song or text that indicates repeated versus in the lyrics, such \\[Chorus\\] or \\[Chorus:\\]. \n",

These aren't clear to our models so we will want to add clear markers to the text to indicate thes occurances. By doing so, we hope to aid our model in identifying, learning, and generating these patterns and sructures.\n",

    "#### Removing Verse Placeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important of these three issues is probably the verse placeholders. These are in the song lyrics to either indicate the different sections of the song and/or to repeat these sections within explicitly repeating the whole text. However, I find it unlikely that our model would pick up on these conventions since they are very high level and used sporadically within our dataset. As such, it is probably best we remove them entirely and replace the placeholders with the text they mean to represent. Then we can just hope and pray that our model understands that verses tend to repeat when it trains on thousands of songs with repeating verses. To help us understand what we ned to accomplish, below are a few examples of these placeholders within song text."

    "Notice the first song is an example of where the placeholders represent chunks of the song. The section below \"\\[Chorus:\\]\" defines what the chorus is, and the next use of \"\\[Chorus\\]\" is meant to repeat this chunk of lyrics. In the second song we see an example of these placeholders simply identifying the different structural components of the song, from verses, to chorus, bridges, etc. These will be a bit easier to handle since they don't replace any text, so we just need to remove the placeholders. Before we go pulling sections from our song, lets try and identify what types of placeholders we have. Below we scan over our song texts and pull out these various placeholders."

Unfortunately, there are 4 other songs which have much stranger formattings that I could not work around. As a result, this will only leave us with 83 out of 87 of our Steely Dan songs for training. Though we made the function specifically, for the Steely Dan songs, we might as well run it on the whole dataset to save as many songs as we can. Many of the others follow the same Chorus format, which is the most common of these issues, so we could save a significant amount of records.

Typically this information is listed in the song between parenthesis, and from what I can tell is most often used to indicate backup vocals, the artist performing the song, and extrneous sounds in the music. None of these are very useful for the model we want to train, so let's try and remove as much as we can.

Some of the whitespace served to break up verse, some is meaningless, and some we accidentally created when removing other unwanted text. Ideally, we would leave in the breaks between verses in the hopes that our model could learn this structural pattern. However, with this being our first language model, we are going for simplicity and instead elect to remove the verse breaks, so the only meaningul structure in each song is a line. Below we remove instances of extended whitespace and remove these extra lines. Afterwords we display the same song as above to show the difference."

Ideally, we would like our model to understand the meaning of capitalized words and their use, but once again we are going for simplicity. For the most part, our capitalized words are just the first word of each line. This is really just a format and we could understand the lyrics just as well if the words were lowercase. So instead of hoping that our model catches onto this pattern, we will just make everything lowercase. This also has the added benefit of reducing the vocabulary space for our model, since it now does not have to differentiate between a word and its capitalized version. The only downside to doing this is that it might affect proper nouns and our models use of them. We think these are too far and in-between to make a significant impact. We may have to address this if it becomes an issue though.\n",

Firstly, each of these characters carries their own special meaning seperate from the word they are attached to. In act the fact they are attached to a word is just a formatting convention. Because of this it makes sense to treat them as separate elements that our model needs to learn how to use properly. Secondly, separating these characters from the words they are attached to significantly reduces our vocabulary space. If ever possible combination of word and punctuation existed, then our sample space would be 7 times as large.\n",

    "The last transformation we need to do to our dataset is reformat it as a single array. This is a conveniant format that we can save in a json file and then reload later when training our models. In doing so, we are also going to create several versions of our datasets and for each we will create a training set as well as a validation set. We need multiple types of datasets because the various models we will train take different inputs. Primarily, some of the models will take variable length seqeunces for which we will combine all the songs into a single sequence, and the other models will train on each individual song. Additionally, we are going to separate out just the Steely Dan songs into their own set since we fill fine tune our models using just these songs. Below is a description of the 4 datasets we will create:\n",

    "    1) All Songs, Single Sequence: All the songs combined into a single sequence (includes Steely Dan songs)\n",

    "    4) Steely Dan Songs Separated: Steely Dan songs combined into a single\n",
    "    \n",
    "For each of these datasets we will have both a training set and a validation set. The validation and training songs will be randomly chosen, but will be the same between the sets, so the single sequence set has the same songs as the separated sequences set. We will partition 10% of the set for validation. "
